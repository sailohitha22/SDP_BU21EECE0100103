Objective:
- The objective of this code seems to be controlling the behavior of the output port P1 based on the states of two switches (sw1 and sw2).
- When both switches are off (sw1 == 0 and sw2 == 0), P1 is set to all 0s.
- When sw1 is off and sw2 is on (sw1 == 0 and sw2 == 1), P1 alternates between 0xAA and 0x55.
- When sw1 is on and sw2 is off (sw1 == 1 and sw2 == 0), P1 alternates between 0x55 and 0xAA.
- When both switches are on (sw1 == 1 and sw2 == 1), P1 alternates between 0x55 and 0xAA with a delay of 5000 iterations of the delay function.

        }
        else if (sw1 == 0 && sw2 == 1)
